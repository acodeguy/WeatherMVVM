# WeatherMVVM
### A weather app built using the MVVM design pattern

## Background
I wanted to learn to use the Model-View-ViewModel design pattern, so I've built this simple weather app that pulls data from the Meta Weather API.

## The Model-View-ViewModel Design Pattern
Models work just as with MVC, no real changes there. They continue to hold the application's data.

### Model <-|-> Presenter <-|-> View

## Tests
In progress...
